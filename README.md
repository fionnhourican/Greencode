# 🌱 Greencode

**Greencode** is an upcoming suite of tools that helps developers write more efficient and sustainable software — starting with `Greencode: BigO`, a VS Code extension for real-time time and space complexity analysis.

---

## 📦 What's Coming

### `Greencode: BigO`
A VS Code extension that provides:

- 🔍 Inline time and space complexity estimates (Big O notation)
- 💡 Warnings about inefficient patterns like nested loops and recursion
- 📚 Suggestions for greener alternatives (e.g., better algorithms or data structures)

> Because more efficient code means faster software and a smaller environmental footprint.
